\section*{Concluding Remarks}
Finally, it can be said that the generation of new queries happens correctly 
and that the system that obtains the best performance is \emph{Gensim}. However, 
there are some points that need to be improved, such as determining 
a method that sets a threshold useful for generating each ranking of 
relevant documents. During the project, the thresholds returned by the 
'$precision\_recall\_curve$' method of the sklearn library were taken into consideration. 
Unfortunately, not all of these had a useful score to be able to take 
into consideration the target document. It was therefore decided to take into 
consideration the initial threshold, referred to the weight, which the method 
of cosine similarity assigned to the target document. In addition, to speed 
up searches, an ad hoc threshold was set to prevent the ranking of relevant 
documents from containing all the documents in the collection. Another improvement 
concerns the reduction of the sparsity of the term-term matrix 
(with \emph{stochastic gradient descent}). As for the use of the different parsers, 
as a future development it would be interesting to develop a hybrid system, 
capable of generating a high number of queries in a low computational time. 
In addition to this, it would be interesting to adopt a method capable of 
expanding the original query with the terms present in a vocabulary such as 
Wordnet.
