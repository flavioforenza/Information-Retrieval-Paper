\section*{Experimental Results}

The dataset used for the experiments is the famous \emph{Recipes1M+} \cite{15}, a collection 
created by MIT, consisting of more than one million culinary recipes. Of 
all these recipes, only a subset of 51235 documents of it was used due to their 
informative content which best fits the purpose of this study. The information 
about the line distributions for each recipe indicates that the instruction 
field contains a higher number than the information contained in the ingredients 
field. To have good performance in finding, we preferred to choose the 
"instructions" field (Fig. \ref{distributions}). The first ranking of relevant documents, generated 
by the tf-idf method, was evaluated following two different approaches that 
could best be linked with the principle explained in \cite{16}. Specifically, each 
category of a recipe is considered as an entity associated with a document. 
Both approaches rely on being able to compare the categories of relevant 
documents with the category of the target document. Since the categories 
are not present in the dataset, the two proposed approaches deal with being 
able to "extract" these categories directly from the web. The first approach 
uses an API, called \href{https://pypi.org/project/scrape-schema-recipe/}{\emph{Scrape Schema Recipe}}, which takes the link associated 
with the recipe website, present in the dataset, and scrapes the corresponding 
category. Unfortunately not all the links are still existing, therefore the 
evaluation of the ranking takes place following three types of methods:
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \label{distributions}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item {\bfseries Overestimated}: consider the uncategorized document as good;
    \item {\bfseries Underestimated}: considers the uncategorized document not good;
    \item {\bfseries Discarded}: Discard the uncategorized document from the evaluation.
\end{enumerate}
As for the second method, this makes use of the \href{https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/api-guide.html}{\emph{USDA}} API, a library that 
has the task of taking every single ingredient of the recipe and fetching the 
corresponding category from a large database belonging to the United States 
Department of Agriculture. Compared to the first approach, the recipes that 
did not have a category are only four recipes. It is worth mentioning that both 
approaches are computationally expensive as the extraction of all categories 
took about two days. In addition to all these evaluations, it was decided to 
create a last one derived from a mixed approach (Scrape + USDA). Taking 
five random queries, the evaluations of the corresponding rankings are those 
reported in table (\ref{avgp}).

    \caption{Average Precision on each query for each method.}
    \label{avgp}
\end{table}
As you can see, the mixed approach is the one that, in 
terms of average precision, manages to achieve the best evaluation. The 
performances, in terms of precision, recall and interpolated recall, visible in 
(Fig. \ref{Performance mixed approach}), demonstrate that the mixed approach is the best.

\end{figure}
Moving 
on to the evaluation of the new queries generated, a visual comparison, based 
on a PCA, was used between the ranking generated by the tf-idf method and 
each new query produced by the project core (Fig. \ref{PCA}). 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width =\linewidth]{images/PCA paper/PCA all.png}
    \centering
    \caption{Distance within the PCA between the original query (top) and the expanded query (bottom).}
    \label{PCA}
\end{figure}
The goal is to find a query 
whose distance from the target document is less than all other distances 
produced by the remaining queries. As we can see, compared to the position 
of the original query, a query with a smaller distance has always been found.
For each new query generated, the perplexity is calculated as the skip-grams 
step varies, with the language model of the target document. After various 
tests, with a higher number of queries, it can be stated that the skip-gram 
step and the perplexity are two inversely proportional measures, that is, as 
the step \emph{s} increases, the perplexity \emph{p} decreases. The same behavior occurs 
with the $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ parameters present in the interpolated smoothing. When  
$\lambda_1$ is less than  $\lambda_2$, perplexity always tends to decrease (Fig. \ref{perplexity}).

    \caption{Variation of the perplexity value based on the change of the step \emph{s} and of the $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ values of interpolated smoothing.}
    \label{perplexity}
\end{figure}
We have come 
to the point of asking: How can the whole system be evaluated? To answer 
this question, four different libraries able to tokenize documents and queries 
were used: {\bfseries{Spacy}}, {\bfseries{Gensim}}, {\bfseries{Nltk}} and {\bfseries{Keras}}. Each of these produces different 
results in terms of perplexity, number of queries generated, sparsity index 
(Tab. \ref{performance}) and rankings(Tab. \ref{Index}). As can be seen from the data, each method has a different 
benefit. What each method has in common is the positioning of the target 
document in the first position of the ranking.

    \caption{Performance in terms of number of queries (\#Queries), Average Sparsity reduction with the SVD method and computation time.}
    \label{performance}
\end{table}
Looking at the results obtained with an additional five queries (\ref{DP}), for a total 
of ten queries, we can see that the best results come from Gensim. This is 
therefore able to find a greater number of queries that have less perplexity 
with the target document than the other methods. To verify the veracity 
of the results, the Euclidean distance between the new query and the target 
document was calculated. As you can see, a smaller distance implies a lower 
perplexity between the query and the target document. As for the other 
systems, Keras and Nltk obtain similar results, unlike the latter producing 
queries with the highest perplexity. As for Spacy, this produces queries with 
the greatest distance from the target document and in fact, comparing with 
the results obtained with Gensim, we can see that as the distance increases, 
the perplexity of each specific queries generated by Spacy also increases.
