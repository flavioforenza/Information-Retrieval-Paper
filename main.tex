\begin{abstract}
  The use of different methods of language modeling, within the field 
  of information retrieval, is finding a wide diffusion in the state of the 
  art. Based on the accuracy of the language model, the problem related 
  to the information retrieval, in a large corpus of documents, can be 
  solved. In order to do this, the basic idea of these approaches is to 
  estimate a probabilistic linguistic model, for each document in the 
  collection, which is able to generate a ranking of relevant documents 
  given a query. One of the problems that afflicts this family of methods 
  is due to the lack of data present. From this, it is necessary to apply 
  smoothing techniques capable of adjusting the maximum likelihood 
  estimator in order to correct the generated imprecision. This paper 
  shows how their application outperforms the performance of classic 
  methods, such as \emph{tf-idf}, useful for generating rankings of 
  documents ordered by relevance. Using them, we will look at some concepts that 
  are useful for query expansion.
